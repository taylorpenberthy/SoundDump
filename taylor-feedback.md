## Technical Requirements - Excelling

Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

- Well-done on the 3rd-party API integration with Spotify! It is apparent that you worked very hard on this part of your app. Great job on making it work!!

## Creativity and Interface - Performing

The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS.

- Your app looks really good in the browser!

## Code Quality - Excelling

No major code quality issues, makes use of JS best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

- Make sure to remove any extraneous whitespaces from your code (e.g., lines 17-18 of https://github.com/taylorpenberthy/project2forreal/blob/master/controllers/users.js)
- Also make sure the code indentation is consistent throughout the codebase (i.e., pick either 2 or 4 spaces for code indentation and stick with that option throughout all your files)
- Nice job separating out your files into models, views, and controllers!

## Functionality - Excelling

App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc.

- Great job integrating with the Spotify API!

## Planning/Process/Submission - Performing

Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. Submission includes a readme and planning directory.

- Your readme is also informative! I thought the format made a lot of sense and was easy to understand. Great job on the screencast!

## Additional Feedback

- Take a look at some of my inline comments on your code.
- Take a look at how I've used the prettier VSCode plugin to automatically clean up your code formatting!
